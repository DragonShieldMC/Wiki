# ‚öîÔ∏è Bosses



The Crimson Forest is a twisted realm where reality itself has been corrupted by the insidious red rot. This malevolent force spreads through every tree, every blade of grass, and every breath of air, mutating all souls and creatures unfortunate enough to be caught in its grasp. What was once a vibrant woodland has become a nightmarish landscape where the very essence of life is perverted and transformed into something dark and unrecognizable.

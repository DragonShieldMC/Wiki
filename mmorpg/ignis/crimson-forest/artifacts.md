# ðŸ“¿ Artifacts

The Crimson Forest is home to a wide range of early relicsâ€”most ranked **F** or **E**â€”but donâ€™t let their low rank fool you. These artifacts carry the memories of long-forgotten warriors, beasts, and kings.\
This area also introduces the game's **first artifact set**: the **Legend Set**.&#x20;

>
> Unlike most Ignis creatures, the Giant Fungi is not violent by nature. It grew slowly beneath the warped Nylium, absorbing Warped energy, feeding off ambient heat and soul residue. Over centuries, it awakened‚Äînot as a beast, but as a caretaker.

**üìñ Lore: Charon**

> Long ago, Charon was a human‚Äîan archivist and soul scholar, driven by a fear of death and a hunger for knowledge. He discovered the Cathedral during an excavation of ancient ruins, and once inside, he never returned.
>
> Or rather‚Äîhis body never returned.
>
> Inside, he found the Veil Scripts, an ancient language capable of separating body and soul, allowing a person to escape death... but at a cost. Eager to understand it, he bound his soul to the cathedral, hoping to find a way to return to flesh once he fully deciphered the code.
>
> But the longer he stayed, the more the cathedral fed on his humanity, twisting his body into a giant wraith-like form‚Äîa shadowy, skeletal figure cloaked in white spell-cloth, with glowing runes etched into his bone.
>
> Now, centuries later, he remains... obsessed, nearly mindless, yet still whispering the same phrase over and over in ancient tongue:
>
> ```
> "I am not yet lost..."
> ```

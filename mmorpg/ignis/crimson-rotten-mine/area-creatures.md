# üëπ Area Creatures

### üêæ Area Creatures

The **Crimson Rotten Mine** is home to two primary enemy types: the **Crimson Basilisk** and the **Crimson Rat**. Each brings a unique threat to the table, and learning their behavior is key to surviving your first descent.

***

### Crimson Basilisk

Fierce and territorial, **Crimson Basilisks** are the apex predators of the mine.

* **Base HP:** 60 ‚ù§Ô∏è _(+20 per additional player in combat ‚Äì HP scales with party size)_
* **Abilities:**
  * **Leap Attack:** A direct, lunging strike that deals moderate damage. Can stagger players on hit.
  *   **Smoke Attack:** Releases a **crimson toxic cloud** that inflicts **heavy instant damage**.

      > ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Standing in the smoke for more than **2 seconds is fatal**. Stay mobile or use crowd control to prevent the Basilisk from casting.

These creatures are especially dangerous in tight spaces. Pull them carefully and watch for smoke zones.

### Crimson Rat

Smaller but no less dangerous, **Crimson Rats** are fast, chaotic enemies designed to harass and disrupt.

* **Base HP:** 60 ‚ù§Ô∏è _(+20 per additional player in combat)_
* **Abilities:**
  * **Leap:** A short-range jump that closes distance and can knock players off balance.
  * **Bite Attack:** Fast, repeated melee strikes that can interrupt your actions.

Though they don‚Äôt deal high damage alone, **Crimson Rats** are built to **knock players into hazards**, especially Basilisk smoke zones. Left unchecked, they can quickly turn a simple fight into a disaster.\

#### üß† Strategy Tips

* **Focus Fire:** Always eliminate **Crimson Rats first** in mixed groups to avoid knockbacks into smoke zones.
* **Keep Moving:** Against Basilisks, avoid standing still for more than a second ‚Äî smoke can spawn suddenly.
* **Solo Players:** Be cautious when triggering large groups. Both creature types scale with player count, making crowd control and positioning vital.

# ‚öîÔ∏è Bosses

The **Weeping Valley** is not only home to cursed creatures, but also to tormented beings of immense power‚Äîbosses shaped by the valley‚Äôs grief and corruption. These encounters are meant to test your timing, awareness, and endurance. Each boss guards a powerful reward, but defeating them will also inch you closer to unraveling the valley‚Äôs grim legacy.

### ü™¶ Thanatos, The Forsaken Choir

Once a temple guardian sworn to protect the souls of fallen warriors, **Thanatos** was twisted into a skeletal abomination by the very spirits he failed to protect. Now residing atop the **Scorpion Ridges**, he eternally screams their sorrow into the wind.\

      > ‚ö†Ô∏è This attack is the core mechanic of the fight. Think of it as a rhythm game: time your jumps over shifting bone platforms and dodge the scream‚Äôs pulse.

#### üìñ Lore: The Judge

> &#x20;Thanatos was once the Valley‚Äôs sacred judge, his voice used to guide souls to peace. Now, corrupted by grief, he uses that same voice to tear them apart. His fall marked the beginning of the Weeping Valley‚Äôs descent into madness.

> Once a general of the old underworld, the Capra Demon betrayed death itself to claim power over the afterlife. His chains hold not just bodies‚Äîbut regrets, failures, and memories. With every soul he binds, his own grows heavier. Slaying him releases the Valley‚Äôs trapped souls, and brings a glimmer of peace to the dead.

### ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/cosmic_ally.png) Drops Info

The Mortuus Tomb is a very special Artifact in the future it will be upgradable to an Emblem.\

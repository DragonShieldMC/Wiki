# 🏯 Arg

Welcome to **Arg**, Dragon Shield's unique dungeon resource world that perfectly blends modded survival and MMORPG elements!

### 🌐 What is Arg?

Arg represents Dragon Shield's philosophy of mixing modded survival and MMORPG concepts. After all, this is still Minecraft - it would be foolish to completely remove mining and crafting from the experience! Arg demonstrates how these two gameplay styles can work together seamlessly.

**Concept:** A dungeon-focused resource world that combines exploration, combat, and resource gathering.

* **Fresh dungeons** to explore and conquer

This reset cycle ensures that everyone gets regular opportunities to find rare gear and experience new content.

### General Structure

Plains Pillager Camp is primarily a wool campground. Structures only generate on the ground and are very easy to find. Also, there are large scale ones and small scale ones.

#### Find  the boss

* Bosses only spawn in large pillager camps. The smaller Pillager Camp has a mini raid.
* The boss is in the central, largest tent.

#### Mini Raid

* You will find a campfire with soul particles in the middle of smaller Pillager Camps. Light it up to start the mini raid
* Pillagers, Vindicators, and Evokers spawn randomly in mini-raids.

#### Fight the Camp Chief

* Camp Chief's crossbow has multishot.
* The Camp Chief blows goat horns to summon pillagers and vindicators. Evokers will also be summoned when your health is low.
* The Camp Chief can attack with a rain of arrows, or spawn TNT that doesn't destroy terrain while creating a protective barrier around the Camp Chief.

#### Tips and warnings

* It is better to defeat the surrounding pillagers before challenging the mini-raid or camp chief.
* If you clear the mini-raid, you can get the dungeon map of the large-scale Plains Pillager Camp as one of the rewards.

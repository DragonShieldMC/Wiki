# 🏆 Area Cleared

**Area Completion and Progression**\
After defeating the boss of an area, that area is marked as _cleared_. Once cleared, standard enemies (mobs) will no longer spawn in that zone. A new area will then unlock, allowing players to continue their progression.

In a future update, a **New Game+** mode is planned. This feature will let players revisit previously cleared areas with increased difficulty, providing an opportunity to collect any missed items or complete unfinished objectives.

# ⚔️ Party System

Parties allow players to Complete Quests together, for example if Steven31 kills a Warped Creeper it will also count for JohnDragonShield1 who's in the same party.&#x20;

There's also a party chat which can be accessed with "`/p chat message`". Toggling it currently doesn't work as it should we're working on this issue. \
\
To make a party do `/party create`, to add someone do `/party invite`.

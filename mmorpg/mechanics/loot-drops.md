# Loot Drops

In MMORPG areas there's a couple things to know about loot drops.&#x20;

### ðŸ§Œ Mob and Mini Boss Drops

These drops are gotten from Chests which the Mobs Drops on Death. If the chest contains an item every player who did damage to the mob in the radius of chest will get the item. \

### ðŸ‘¹Boss Drops

Souls, Weapons Items and more dropped from bosses are handled by the Quest system, if you <mark style="color:red;">**didn't get a drop from a boss check if you completed the /quest!**</mark>

The abominable Yeti is a boss that spawns only in Aten, but that doesn't make him an easy foe to defeat.&#x20;

First of all, this hulking beast is powerful enough to launch you flying with his powerful arms. It can also breathe cold air at you, causing freezing over time. Lastly, this creature can pick up large amounts of snow and weaponize it.&#x20;

Some say that there's a way to stun this creature for a few seconds, but this last bit is just a rumor that has to be proven...

#### And What is a Water Spellbook?

Great question! In Dragon's Shield there's a unique mana system where you can cast spells and skills from special items, and this spellbook is one of them, the very first one if I must add.

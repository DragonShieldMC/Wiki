# üåç Overworld

This is were all minecrafters start their journey, but there's a few things you should know about...

First of all, here on Dragon Shield there's three different Overworld maps you should be aware of.

### [<mark style="color:blue;">Aten</mark>](../about-aten.md)

The first and easiest world, perfect for building your base and starting your adventure. Explore naturally generating dungeons and encounter adorable new creatures like boars, buffalo, penguins, and more! Aten is your safe haven, the place you‚Äôll return to after every hard-fought battle. And rest assured, this world will never reset! We will just expand it if needed although that won't be for a while as the current worldsize is 150000 border!

### [<mark style="color:yellow;">Arg</mark>](../about-arg/)

Our second world is a resource-rich dungeon realm! While you can‚Äôt build here, you‚Äôre free to break and gather all the resources you need. Dungeons spawn more frequently, offering fresh loot with each adventure. Arg resets monthly to keep things exciting, and features hourly boss battles, with a new boss spawning every 4 hours somewhere in the world for you to challenge.

### [<mark style="color:red;">Durel</mark>](./#durel)

The third and most challenging world‚Äîwelcome to your nightmare. Building is off-limits here, but you can mine in search of <mark style="color:purple;">**custom ores stronger than netherite**</mark> while facing relentless attacks from terrifying custom mobs like goblins, kobolds, and even dragons. Durel is not for the faint-hearted‚Äîthis truly hellish landscape will push your survival skills to the limit.

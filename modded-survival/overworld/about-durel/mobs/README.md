# ðŸ‘½ Mobs

## The Stars of the Show

Mobs in Durel have levels. Their level increases with every 25 blocks from 0,0 meaning the further away you get from 0,0 the more powerful they get. But keep in mind they do drop alot more exp loot and items. We're working on giving them custom drops which will be coming in the near future. Their HP, Damage and Speed increases which each level up the max being 1000 atm. That can one shot Malachite Protection 4. Be careful when going to 20k.

Not all is bad news though, as mobs coming from spawners won't have any extra levels.

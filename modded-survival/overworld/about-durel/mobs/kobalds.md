# ðŸ¦Ž Kobalds

These little enemies may look harmless at first sign, but they do pack a punch when they come in groups, and you may encounter plenty of them in Durel.&#x20;

Most of their attacks can inflict some ailments, such as Slowness, Mining Fatigue, and even Levitation, so better be prepared before engaging them in combat. They are great swimmers, so you can't escape them in the water:

* **Kobald soldiers:** low rank soldiers from this faction, capable of swift sword swings and chase easily most unaware adventurers. Can disable shields with their regular attacks.

* **Kobald Archers:** long-range attackers, skilled in the use of bows. Their shots are very fast and accurate, and don't think about using shields; they are of no use against them, as their shots pierce through them.

* **Kobald Spearsman:** a high-rank Kobald Soldier that uses a spear. Uses very long range attacks and combos, and can disable shields. They are also very resistant to arrows.

* **Kobald Wizard:** it is highest-ranked Kobald and the most dangerous, yet fragile of them all. Can cast several long-range spells, including fire balls, energy balls, and spread attacks. Kill him first before it kills you!

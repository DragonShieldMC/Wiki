# 🐑 New Animals

If you have visited the Overworld, then you most likely have seen some classic mobs such as cows, sheeps, chickens, cats, wolfs, and even axolotls. However, that's not all there is to see in here; in fact, Aten is home to many unique animals that not only will enrich the land, but also may provide useful loot to create new items and tools to make your progression even more interesting.

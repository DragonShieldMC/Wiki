There are a few biomes in which these speedy tanks spawn in. These include:

* Deserts
* Badlands
* Eroded Badlands
* Savanna Plateau
* Savanna
* Windswept Savanna
* Wooded Badlands
* Bryce Canyons



Buffalos do have 2 items which they drop. These are buffalo meat and buffalo wool. When the Buffalo meat is cooked it give up to 8 hunger while also giving 1 second of regen 3 buff.

Buffalo wool is also useful as it can be used to craft a buffalo backpack. (recipe below)

In order to make these backpacks function you must visit Hirmi in Maister Village. He is found at /warp MaisterVillage across the bridge.

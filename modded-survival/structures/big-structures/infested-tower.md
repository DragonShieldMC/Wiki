# üè∞ Infested Tower

**Found in:** All Overworld

This mysterious structure, also called the "Chinese Tower" due to its design, has been observed in several biomes in the Overworld, yet its true purpose is shrouded in mystery. Explorers believe that these massive buildings were designed to test adventurers, as few of them who have lived to tell the tale have confirmed that a massive bounty and treasure is waiting at the very top of these towers.

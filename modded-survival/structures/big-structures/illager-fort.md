# üè∞ Illager fort

**Found in:** All Overworld

A massive fort found mostly in plains and taiga biomes, and its heavily guarded by all types of illagers; pillagers, vindicators, evokers, and even illusioners! These illagers are far stronger that your average enemies, so you can be quickly overwhelmed in this dungeon if you don't proceed with caution!

### Items to obtain

* Iron ingots, Gold ingots, Emeralds, Diamonds.
* Totems of Undying (Dropped from evokers)
* Iron gear, Diamond gear.
* Vex Trims

### Tips

* Vindicators are immune to knockback in this structure. Swords are not very effective against them.
* Evokers attack in groups; if you hit an illager or if one see you, all evokers in the vicinity will spawn spells and summon vexes on you. It is strongly recommended to dispatch them all before fully exploring this structure.
* Almost all rooms of this structure have chests to loot. Some are even hidden, so make sure to fully explore it!

# â­• Old Refinery

**Found in:&#x20;**<mark style="color:blue;">**Aten**</mark>

The Old refinery is an abandoned underground building made to treat ores obtained underground. It contains everything you need to take a break while mining, and perhaps the old forgotten tools of the miners that once worked in these dark corridors are still lying around the place.

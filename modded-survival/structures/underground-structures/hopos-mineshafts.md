# â­• Hopo's Mineshafts

**Found in:** All Overworld

There was once a miner called Hopo, whose only goal was to create the biggest mineshaft ever seen, and he made it!&#x20;

These unique mineshafts can be really massive, with several rooms and even way stronger and faster enemies than usual. You can access to the different floors of this mineshaft by using regular stairs or with a fully-working redstone elevator, found commonly in these corridors and rarely above the ground.

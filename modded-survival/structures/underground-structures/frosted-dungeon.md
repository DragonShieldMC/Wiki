# â­• Frosted Dungeon

**Found in:&#x20;**<mark style="color:blue;">**Aten**</mark>

The Frosted dungeon is an ominous small decorated Deepslate-based square structure found only in the Frostfire caves with a random spawner inside, just like Vanilla dungeons. Some of these Frosted Dungeons may also offer a handsome reward in the form of diamond and other valuable gear and loot inside their chests.

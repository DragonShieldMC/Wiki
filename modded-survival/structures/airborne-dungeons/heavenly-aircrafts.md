# 🛩️ Heavenly Aircrafts

**Found in:** All Overworld

The "Conqueror", the "Challenger" and the "Rider" are three otherworldly ships found very high in the skies of the overworld, and sometimes in the End, which leads adventurers to believe that these aircrafts are capable to travel through dimensions.

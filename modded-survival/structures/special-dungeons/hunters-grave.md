### General Structure

The Hunter's grave is a large sword sticking out from the mountain so it's easily recognizable from a long distance. Notice that, at the bottom of the sword , there's a bow sticking to the ground, and at the top of the sword there is four gold blocks.

#### Locate the grave

* This should be easy as this structure has a very unique shape and is huge.
* Once you have reached the grave find a bow sticking to the ground.

#### Fight the hunter ghost

* Pick the bow up by right clicking with an empty hand.
* The hunter's ghost will spawn right at the bow so prepare for the fight.
* Fight the ghost until it starts giving off soul particles, then attack it with the Broken Bow.
* Try your best to finish off the ghost with the bow you just picked up. Note that the bow has only 7 uses so only use it to finish him off.
* After killing the ghost, your Broken Bow will turn into an unbreakable Hunter's Bow!

#### Tips and Warnings

* As you fight the ghost, he may teleport around so keep your eyes peeled.
* Only the last hit matters that you use the bow you have just picked up. You can even slash him with a smite sword until it almost dies then finish him off with the bow.
* The Broken Bow has only seven uses.

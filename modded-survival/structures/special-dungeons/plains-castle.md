### General Structure

This castle is smaller than most other dungeons in the Overworld, but can contain a fair decent amount of loot, ranging from iron ingots to "Treasure" vanilla items; items that have impossible enchants. There are two main challenges to complete in this dungeon:

* **The Spawner Trial:** there are several spawners scattered around the dungeon. Once you destroy them all, a chest will be unlocked in the middle of the castle with the best loot.
* **The Gauntlet:** a special trial were you must light a campfire in order to summon a horde of mobs. You will have a few seconds to kill them all and, once you do, a special chest will spawn near the campfire.

### Loot

* Iron Ingots, Diamonds
* Iron and Diamond tools
* Forbidden Fruits
* "Treasure" items (vanilla items with impossible enchants)

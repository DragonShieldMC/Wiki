### General Structure

The Plains Labyrinth is a labyrinth made of stone bricks. The structure is huge and should be easy to spot. Structures are generated above and below ground, and contain several special rooms.

#### Special room

* Monoliths
* A prison where villagers are held
* Boss room

#### How to beat the boss

* The boss room is located in the basement of the Labyrinth.
* To get to the basement, you need to open the spawner chest between the middle of the labyrinth.
* When you open the spawner chest, a hole will open in a part of the stairs, so jump down there. There is water, so you don't have to worry about falling damage.

#### Fight Chaos Spawner

* Destroy the spawner in the center of the boss room to start the battle.
* Breaking it with a pickaxe will damage the Chaos Spawner.
* Chaos spawners summon zombies, skeletons and spiders.
* In addition, it will attack using a wide range of wither magic and flame bullets.

#### Tips and Warnings

* This dungeon occasionally spawns baby zombies wearing diamond armor and diamond axes. They also take no knockback, so be careful.
* There is also a lava pitfall, so bring a Water Bucket.

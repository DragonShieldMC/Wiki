**Found in:** All Overworld

A tall mineshaft found in the overworld and sustained by mushrooms, giving it its name. It seems a plague that spread in these mines killed their inhabitants, who have now turned into undeads.

### Items to obtain:

* Iron ingot, Gold Ingots, Diamonds (found at the top chest only)
* Iron gear, diamond gear (found at the top chest only, and drop from Zombie Miner).

### Tips

* All Zombie miners have pickaxes that are enchanted with Sharpness, which make them slightly dangerous than usual. There is a chance to obtain such picks after killing them, making it the only way to obtain Sharpness Pickaxes.

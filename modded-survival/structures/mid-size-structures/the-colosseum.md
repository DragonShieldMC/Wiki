# ðŸ—¼ The Colosseum

**Found in:** All Overworld

A massive structure found all over the overworld. A lot of dead soldiers patrol the surroundings of the area, yet the main event is the gladiator; a skull riding a phantom capable of shooting enchanted arrows at you.

### Items to obtain:

* Diamonds (upon killing the gladiator)
* Uncrafteable potion: gives several benefits to the user (drop from the gladiator).

### Tips

* The gladiator shoots dangerous levitate IV arrows, which makes you float faster than shulker bullets. Be prepared to hit the ground a lot.

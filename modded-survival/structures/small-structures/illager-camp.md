**Found in:&#x20;**<mark style="color:orange;">**Arg**</mark>, <mark style="color:red;">**Durel**</mark> (Very rarely in <mark style="color:blue;">**Aten**</mark>)

A very common structure found all over the world, where around 3 to 5 illagers gather before continuing their explorations. They may have a few captured villagers, although this is not common to be seen.

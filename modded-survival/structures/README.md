# üè® Structures

The Overworld is home to a dozen of different structures you may find across the land. Some hold a good amount of resources to progress through your journey, although they can be guarded by very strong creatures, while other have amazing puzzles to solve and incredible custom loot to obtain.

Of course, you may still be able to find some classic structures available in Minecraft, such as Pillager Outposts, Ocean Monuments, Ancients Cities, and more.

Here we will take a deeper look on some of the custom structures you may find in this land.

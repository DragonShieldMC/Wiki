# üõ°Ô∏è Armors

The gear in  this list is made for starter players, and it is as strong as vanilla gear, hence the name. It can also be crafted using vanilla resources.

## <mark style="color:purple;">Amethyst Armor</mark> ![](../.gitbook/assets/a4.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/a3.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/a2.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/a1.png)

The very first gear you will come with, just as strong as Iron but with lower durability. You cran craft **Amethyst armor** with amethyst shards. You can also claim you first set of amethyst with /kit starter.



## <mark style="color:orange;">Copper Armor</mark> ![](../.gitbook/assets/c1.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/c2.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/c3.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/c4.png)

Copper was once the most useless mineral out there, until now! Here on Dragon Shieldd, you can craft **Copper armor using in**gots and wax. The armor has similar stats to iron, but helps the player circulate mana boosting his over mana stat.



## <mark style="color:green;">Silver Armor</mark> ![](../.gitbook/assets/emerald_helmet.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/emerald_chestplate.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/emerald_leggings.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/emerald_boots.png)

This valuable gem, once used as currency for villager trading, is also a material to craft **Emerald armor**. Just as strong as Diamond, this gear not only offers great protection, but also offers some luck points, which can be useful when exploring the many dungeons in Dragon Shield.

Bear in mind, however, that this armor requires blocks to be crafted, not single emeralds.



## <mark style="color:orange;">Golem Heart Armor</mark>&#x20;

An iron-made magical armor crafted using the remnants of iron golems. The <mark style="color:orange;">Golem-Heart Armor</mark> gives the player a sturdy aura that makes it stronger but also slower. Requires iron blocks for skill activation.

* **Where to craft:** find the monolith recipe in the [Forgotten Fields of Flanders](structures/special-dungeons/forgotten-field-of-flanders.md)

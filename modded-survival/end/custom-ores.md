# ðŸŒŒ Custom Ores

## Enderite

The Enderite ore spawns beyond the main End Island around 4k distance from 0 0. It has a 100% chunk spawn rate and spawns in patches from 0-5. You can also mine for it as it doesn't just generate on air blocks. It's not that rare to find and you will meet it more as you explore the End. It's used for Molds at the moment.

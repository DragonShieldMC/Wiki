## Weapons



![](../../.gitbook/assets/sharanga.png) **Sharanga**

**Sharanga** is a bow which converts Spectral Arrows into Spectral bolts, which pierce infinite number of enemies and travel in a straight line. They also deal 20% more damage compared to regular Arrows. It is dropped by Illusioner in Strongholds. Unless Spectral Arrows are used as ammunition for this Bow, it has no special properties other than increased durability. When using Spectral Arrows as ammunition, they are converted into high velocity Spectral Bolts. Spectral Bolts can pierce an infinite number of enemies, inflicting Glowing for 10 seconds, while moving at 1.2x the speed of standard Arrows. Due to how arrow damage is calculated, this also means a 1.2x damage multiplier. Spectral Bolts travel in a straight line, being completely unnaffected by gravity. Spectral Bolts also explode after hitting a block, or after 1 second. The explosion deals 66% of base arrow damage with 20% armor penetration. It does not increase or decrease with draw time. Just like the Bolts, explosions inflicting Glowing for 10 seconds. Spectral Arrows have a 25% chance to not be used after being fired. This chance doubles with Infinity enchantment for a 50% chance to not be consumed.



![](../../.gitbook/assets/prismatic_punch.png) **Prismatic Punch**

**Prismatic Punch** is a post-Empress crossbow that converts arrows into slow, powerful Prismatic Blasts that home in on enemies, exploding when they come into contact with them. It also inflicts a new damage over time effect known as Prismatic Inferno.

Prismatic Punch transforms any shot Arrow into a powerful Prismatic Blast. They are slow and deccelerate over a timespan of 20 seconds until detonating. They can also bounce off walls.

Prismatic Blasts gain a huge speed bonus when an enemy is nearby, which they will target and home onto, detonating on contact. Explosions deal varying damage, between 4❤️❤️ and 10❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ damage, while also dealing a bit of splash damage to entities around.

Multishot enchantment causes 3 different-colored blasts to be shot in a 50° cone. Piercing causes blasts to sometimes create secondary explosions on other nearby entities, with the max amount of extra explosions being directly defined by the enchantment level. Additional explosions from both Multishot and Piercing enchantments deal reduced damage.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/natures_wrath.png) Nature's Wrath

Visiting certain biomes **while holding Nature's Wrath in any hand** imbues it with a fraction of the biome's power, enhancing the Spirits and adding new types of Spirits which can be fired. The amount of Spirits different from the default one which Nature's Wrath can fire will from now on be referred to as `amount of Spirit Upgrades`.

By default there is a 50% chance to shoot a regular Spirit _(33% if above 7 Spirit Upgrades)_. If not, then a random Spirit from all Spirit Upgrades will be chosen. However, certain Spirit types have a higher chance to be chosen depending on some circumstances:



* Ocean Spirits are 4x more likely to be chosen if user is underwater.
* Mountain Spirits are 3x more likely to be chosen if there are mobs in a 13-23 block radius around the player, but no mobs in a 13 block radius
* Hallowed Spirits are 2x more likely to be chosen if there are are more than 3 undead mobs in a 8 block radius around the player
* Sculk Spirits are 2x more likely to be chosen if there are more than 5 mobs in a 9 block radius around the player

Spirtis can be fired every 1.2 seconds. Each Spirit Upgrade also reduces cooldown at which Nature's Wrath fires by half a tick. Due to rounding of scoreboards in Minecraft, this means that for every 2 Spirit Upgrades, the cooldown will be reduced by 0.05 seconds



Sneaking and right-clicking casts an alternate ability, which summons a pack of Spirit Wolves. They act like regular tamed dogs, however they deal more damage, move quicker and have a bit more health. They automatically despawn after 20 seconds.

The number of Spirit Wolves spawned, as well as their stats, is directly tied to the number of Spirit Upgrades. By default, only 2 will spawn, with 3rd one being spawned at 3 Spirit Upgrades, 4th one at 6 and finally 5th one at 9.

After Spirit Wolves despawn, there is a 20 second cooldown before they can be summoned again

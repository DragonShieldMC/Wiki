# 💀 Crimson Skeletons

These skeletons which ended up in the Nether dropped their bows and took off the crimson vines to use them as whips, with 50 ❤️ and a damage output of 30 they hurt like hell (haha).\
\
They spawn in Weeping Valleys, Infernal Dunes, Nether Wastes, Basalt Deltas and Crimson forests!\
\
They drop Crimson Bones which can be used for either crafting at this moment only the Hell's Bane bow or can be sold to the shop.

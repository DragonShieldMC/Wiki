# 🎚️ Nether Man

The Nethermen are a race of poorly evolved builders which got stuck in the Nether milions of years ago. They changed and now they harvest the energy from dead souls from the Soul Sand. They have 150 ❤️ and deal up to 50 damage!\
\
They Spawn in Soul Sand Valleys, Weeping Valleys and Inverted Forests with a small chance as well in Basalt Deltas. \
\
They drop the Cursed Apple, this apple will transmigrate you into an unknown dimension.. They can also be sold to the shop

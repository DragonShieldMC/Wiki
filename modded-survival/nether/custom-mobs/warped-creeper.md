# üí• Warped Creeper

These guys are horribly horribly deadly, if they explode they'll kill you even in Ruby armor so do watch your back. They have 30 ‚ù§Ô∏è and are a instant death for most. They are although killable. Just be careful they are also much more nimble than normal creepers.\
\
They spawn in Weeping Valleys, Infernal Dunes, Nether Wastes, Basalt Deltas and Crimson forests!\
\
They drop Warped Gunpowder now here's where the fun part comes, there's no modpack without custom tnt! Using the Warped Gunpowder you can craft Warped TNT. This TNT is unstable and with just of a touch it will goo booom! Although do note it does not deal damage to players making it an ideal mining tool.\

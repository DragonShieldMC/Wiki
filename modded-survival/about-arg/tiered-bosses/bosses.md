# ðŸ’€ Bosses

**Strong Mutated Guardian -** This is one of the hardest hitters of the bosses he drops 3 Crates no matter what rarity it is as it truly is one of the hardest ones to deal with.

**Love Guardian -** This is the next trickiest one as she's the only boss who doesn't follow the damage format. Her minimum damage is 17 for Simple and highest is 70 for Legendary. \

**Frozen Guardian -** This is one of the easiest bosses on the server probably. It's easy to dodge and if you're fast enough you'll never get hit it's recommended for starters.\

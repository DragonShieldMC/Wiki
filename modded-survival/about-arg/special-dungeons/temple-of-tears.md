### General Structures

The Temple of Tears is a group of floating blackstone islands. The structure generates several blocks above the ground so the structure can be obviously seen if you aren't deliberately avoiding it when you found one.

#### The island types

* The Main Island
* The Camp
* Ruined Portal
* The Enemy Citadel (x3)
* The Bossfight Island (x3)
* Minor Islands (x6)

#### Locate the boss room

* Find the temple of tears.
* The main bossfight island is at the middle of the temple.

#### Fight the sisters of sorrow (Phase I)

* Pick up the enchanted book to start the first phase.
* Keep shooting the ghasts until they emits soul particles.
* If you want to bail out, do it now. There'll be no turning back later.
* Once the three ghasts emit particles, the next phase begin.

#### Fight the sisters of sorrow (Phase II)

* As the second phase begin, 4 pillars will spawn near each ghast.
* Shoot the target block in those pillars to damage the boss
* As you damage them, they'll shoot fireballs at you and warp around.
* Once all pillars are destroyed, the last phase begins.

#### Fight the sisters of sorrow (Phase III)

* The pillars will be respawned. Shoot them again.
* Each ghast will show their moves. A fire ball airstrike, A Lightning barrage, and a freezing bomb.
* Once the pillars are destroyed, the boss will die and loot chest appears.

**Tips and warnings**

* If you play in a server, one or more sisters can teleport to a random player that isn't even in the fight and destroy whatever is nearby them.
* If you play in a server, bringing a team of _at least 3 players_ is highly recommended.
* The sisters of sorrow will follow you in the latter two phases, there is no use running away as they will follow you.
* Third phase ghasts can grief your builds to smithereens, standing your ground and killing the boss is your only option.
* A full durability enchanted netherite/golem heart armor is a must. They are a _very tough_ boss to beat.

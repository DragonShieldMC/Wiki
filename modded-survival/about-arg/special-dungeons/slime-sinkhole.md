### General Structure

Slime sinkhole is a sinkhole with an entry above the ground. The structure is mostly underground but it's fairly recognizable from the ground due to a stone entry point. It contains several parts.

#### Parts of slime sinkhole

* Control stations
* Spawner room
* Witch room
* Boss room

#### Locate the boss room

* Find the slime sinkholes in the swamps
* Get in the sinkholes
* The boss room is the tallest room in the sinkhole (usually 3 floors)

#### Fight the slime core

* Once you get in the boss room, the slime core will be at the highest floor
* It won't move or attack you unless you attack it first. Feel free to set up your plan.
* When you're ready, attack it.

#### Tips and Warnings

* Slime core doesn't move or attack but spawn a lot of slime cubes when take damage. Once the slimes spawn, deal with them first.
* Your armor should have Thorns as the amount of slimes spawn in a wave is so high you can't kill them quickly enough to not take any damage.
* Don't rush this boss or you'll be overwhelmed by tons of slimes. _You are warned._
* Stacking up before the fight can be very helpful, as slimes can only jump so high.

### Loots

#### Slime rods

A carrot on stick that launches slimeballs, inflicting slowness on the target.

How to obtain: Kill the slime core

# 🕐 PlayTime Ranks

## Ranks

Ranks are as in the title playtime based. You're able to check your next rank by literally doing **/nextrank** sometimes if you leave right before rankup the timer messes up so you have to manually claim it from the GUI. To check all ranks do /ranks in-game here's the menu here.\

These ranks give you perks such as setting more homes, money, claimblocks, perks like /hat, /back  and also the ability to pick up spawners at the Ruler rank plus alot more!

# ðŸŒ‹ Stage II

### Ok got the netherite what can I do now?

We like to call this the **exploration stage**. The nether and end are both custom, and have **Stage II** recommended player gear which isn't necessary but it will make your life easier. From [custom nether](../../modded-survival/nether/items.md) items to [custom end](../../modded-survival/end/items.md) armor and items. There's alot you can choose from. You can craft ancient gear from netherite and chorus plating or hallowed ingots. All these can be found in end dungeons/villages. \
Now that you geared up and maxed out in netherite, it's time for your first boss the <mark style="color:yellow;">**Holy Knight**</mark>. To unlock the world with Custom Ore you need to defeat this boss. It's location and info can be found [here. ](../mechanics/progression-bosses/i-holy-knight.md)

### Baby Steps (We're very proud of you)

Now that you've explored until your soul was full of the beauty of the world. The next step is to head back and complete the Quest line until Alruna. You should be able to complete all quests in enchanted netherite armor. There's also [custom enchants](../custom-enchantments/) we recommend you look into as they are an important factor of play. Another factor of play for boosting HP early game is [Forbidden Fruits](../mechanics/forbidden-fruits.md)! They can be gained from fighting [hourly bosses](../../modded-survival/about-arg/tiered-bosses/bosses.md) in Arg, or taking on [structure bosses](../../modded-survival/structures/). It's time to head back to the end and find your self some [Enderite](../../modded-survival/end/custom-ores.md). It's used for crafting molds for all custom gear! Omg it's time.. :)))&#x20;

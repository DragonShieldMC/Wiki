# üèõÔ∏è Player Warps

Player warps are a way for players to set publicly available teleports to anything that they create on the server no matter if it's a shop or an exp farm. \
When you first open the player shop menu by doing **/pw** you'll be greeted by a list where players can advertise all their warps plus a book named <mark style="color:purple;">All Warps</mark> in which you'll be able to see all the current warps on the server.  \

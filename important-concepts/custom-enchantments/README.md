# ðŸª„ Custom Enchantments

## **How Are Custom Enchants Obtained?** ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/exp (1).png>)

You can either do /ce and buy a random rarity book using exp, or get lucky and get one when using an enchanting table. Once receiving a custom book to apply the enchant put into an anvil with your item.



#### Each section of the Custom Enchantment GUI is color-coded so it's easier to process.

**Ok let's now explain what's what:**\
\
<mark style="color:yellow;">**Yellow Area**</mark>\
Here you're able to choose which random enchant book you'd like to buy, sorted by rarity.\
\
<mark style="color:red;">**Red Area**</mark>\
When clicking on the anvil icon in the marked red area you'll be taken to the alchemist menu.

In the alchemist menu you're able to combine two enchantment books of the same type and rarity and level to get a higher leveled book.

It basically works like an anvil.\

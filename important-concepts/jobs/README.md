### üëã Introduction

Our server features a robust Jobs system that lets you earn money by doing what you enjoy most in Minecraft. Whether you're mining deep for rare ores, hunting dangerous mobs, or exploring new territories, there's a job that fits your playstyle.

Each job has unique characteristics, rewards, and challenges. This guide will help you understand how jobs work, which ones might be best for you, and how to maximize your earnings as you play.

### üîç Job Basics

#### Joining Jobs

To join a job, use the command `/jobs join [jobname]`. For example, to join the Miner job, you would type:

```
/jobs join miner
```

You can check which jobs are available with `/jobs browse`, and view your current jobs with `/jobs stats`.

> **NOTE:** There are limits to how many jobs you can join at once, based on your playtime rank. See the Playtime Ranks & Job Limits section for details.

#### Leveling Up

As you perform actions related to your job, you'll earn experience points. Once you've earned enough experience, you'll level up in that job. Each level:

* Increases the money you earn from job-related actions
* Provides a level-up reward (money and XP)
* Gets progressively harder to achieve

To check your current level and progress, use `/jobs stats`.

#### Earning Money

You earn money automatically by performing actions related to your job. The amount earned depends on:

* Your job level (higher levels = more money)
* The specific action performed (rarer actions = more money)
* The number of jobs you have (more jobs = slight penalty per job)

Money is added directly to your balance, which you can check with `/money`.

#### Job Commands

Here are the most useful job commands:

* `/jobs join [jobname]` - Join a specific job
* `/jobs leave [jobname]` - Leave a job
* `/jobs browse` - See available jobs and descriptions
* `/jobs stats` - View your current jobs, levels, and progress
* `/jobs top [jobname]` - See the top players for a specific job
* `/jobs shop` - Open the jobs shop for special perks

### üß∞ Job Types

Jobs are ranked by difficulty from ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (hardest) to ‚≠ê (easiest).

### ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do I switch jobs?**\
A: Use `/jobs leave [old job]` followed by `/jobs join [new job]`. Note that there's a cooldown period when leaving a job before you can rejoin it.

**Q: Will I lose my level if I leave a job?**\
A: No, your level is saved. If you rejoin the same job later, you'll start at the same level.

**Q: Which job makes the most money?**\
A: Miner has the highest income potential, followed by Hunter and Enchanter. However, the "best" job depends on your playstyle and what activities you enjoy.

**Q: Do I get penalties for having multiple jobs?**\
A: Yes, there's a small income reduction (1% per additional job) to balance having multiple income sources.

**Q: Can I join all jobs at once?**\
A: No, you're limited by your playtime rank. See the Playtime Ranks & Job Limits section.

**Q: What happens if I place and then break a block?**\
A: For many jobs (especially Miner), there are penalties for breaking blocks you recently placed to prevent farming.

**Q: How do level rewards work?**\
A: Each time you level up in a job, you receive a money bonus and XP points. These rewards increase with higher levels.

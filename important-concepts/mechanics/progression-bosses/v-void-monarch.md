### Lore

In the dark recesses of an ancient realm, where the fabric of reality frays and unravels, there exists a being of unfathomable power and malevolence - the Void Monarch. Legends speak of this enigmatic entity as the sovereign of nothingness, ruling over the emptiness between stars and the voids between dimensions.

Long ago, before the dawn of time itself, the Void Monarch emerged from the primordial chaos, a being born from the very essence of nothingness. Its form is ever-shifting, a swirling mass of shadows and darkness, with eyes that gleam like dying stars and a voice that echoes through the void like the mournful wails of lost souls.

Throughout the ages, the Void Monarch has lurked in the shadows, biding its time and gathering its power. It is said that the mere presence of this ancient being can drive mortals to madness, twisting their minds and souls until they are but hollow shells of their former selves.

Those who have dared to seek out the Void Monarch, whether out of curiosity, ambition, or desperation, have often met with a fate worse than death. Its domain is a labyrinth of shifting realities and endless corridors of darkness, where time holds no sway and the laws of physics are mere suggestions.

To face the Void Monarch is to confront the very embodiment of oblivion itself, a battle against an opponent that knows no fear, feels no pain, and cannot be reasoned with. Only the bravest and most skilled warriors dare to challenge its might, risking everything in the hope of banishing this ancient evil back to the depths from whence it came.

But beware, for those who seek to vanquish the Void Monarch must be prepared to sacrifice everything, for in the end, victory may come at a price too terrible to bear.\

### Stats

<mark style="color:purple;">**Void Monarch**</mark> has **25k HP (15k HP phase one and 10k HP phase two, with 10k extra health per player in the arena)**, and do notice normal arrows do not work on progression bosses! His path finding focuses on killing everything around it, it's best to have 1-2 tanks in front. He has a couple of different attacks. His void pillars do a lot of damage but are avoidable by either dodging or hiding behind the obsidian pillars in the Arena. He sure is a heavy hitter, so stay on your toes.



### Recommended Gear

It's recommend to either have a party of late game Stage III players so Ruby gear basically. If you wish to try to solo it we truly do recommend end game Stage IV gear. Jade is very necessary to survive most of his attacks. We also recommend getting the Ancient Dragon Shield from Durel.&#x20;

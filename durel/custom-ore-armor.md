# ðŸ¥‡ Custom Ore Armor

Remember when we told you that Netherite is good, but there's better gear to use? Well, all those incredible pieces of gear can be seen here, and if your thing getting ancient debris is hard enought, oh boy... You're up for a ride...

## Before starting...

There's something important you should know about the armor sets in this list. First of all, they all can only be crafted using unique ores that can spawn in <mark style="color:red;">**Durel**</mark>. You can see further details of those ores [here](custom-ores.md).

Additionally, these pieces of gear need a mold to be crafted. To craft a mold, you need first Enderite ingots, which can be smelted from Enderite ores. These unique resources can only be found in, you guessed it, <mark style="color:purple;">**The End**</mark>. Lastly, to craft an specific mold, you need a netherite piece of armor and the mold in a crafting table (place the mold in the middle of the grid and the armor anywhere else).

That explained, let's check out what you need to farm to craft these exclusive armor sets:

## <mark style="color:blue;">Malachite Armor</mark> ![](../.gitbook/assets/malachite_helmet.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/malachite_chestplate.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/malachite_leggings.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/malachite_boots.png)

The very first of the advanced armors, yet stronger than Netherite already.  Malachite ores can be found un Durel above 5k from 0,0 and on Y coords between 0 and -60. All Malachite armor pieces offer a defense level of **60**.

Another set of durable gear that provides **120 defense per piece**, and almost a must for most custom bosses in Dragon Shield. The Amber ores can be usually found in Durel, but only on coords 10k above 0,0 and on Y levels between 0 and -60.

It was discussed if this ore comes from the Nether or not, but truth is that is spawns in the Overworld, most commonly in Durel, between Y coords 0 and -60 and after 15k blocks from 0,0. The farther you are from 0,0, the higher the spawn chance of these ores. It provides **240 defense points each piece**.

This is one of the sturdiests materials ever found, and perhaps the most harder to find, as it only spawns in high-up mountains (Y level between 150 and 200) and only after 20k blocks from 0,0 in Durel. It's the only custom gem that spawns in higths instead of depths, and provides a whooping **360 defense per piece**.

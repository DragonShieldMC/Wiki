# ⚙️ Mechanics

## Teleporting

Commands like /tpa, /tpaccept, and /back are fully disabled for Durel, no elytras or trident travel either!

## Cave Mechanics

In Durel in big caves. or even your own tunnels. will collapse randomly. Not just that but in Durel **hypoxia** exists. What's **hypoxia**? The deeper you go and the smaller the space the less oxygen you'll have. You'll start to choke getting mining fatigue, wither and slowness. Apart from that if you're too heavy in a deep cave you'll also receive slowness and weakness so be carful while exploring.

## No Sunlight!

Be prepared, as there's no day time in Durel; that's right, the moon will be up above in the sky all day.

## Waystone Mechanics

In Durel you aren't able to set a home or even sleep to set your spawn point. The only way to teleport back is to find randomly spawned **Waystones.**

To go back to the Waystone from any part of the server run the <mark style="color:purple;">**/waystone**</mark> command.

## MMORPG Tutorial Guide

Welcome to the full Dragon Shield experience! This tutorial will introduce you to our unique blend of MMORPG mechanics and modded survival gameplay. Your adventure starts here!

### üéØ Your Main Objective

**Goal:** Gain entry to the castle by obtaining `1x Furlin` (server currency)

### üìã Step-by-Step Walkthrough

#### 1. Meet Mark the Trader

* **Location:** On a log near where you spawned
* **Quest:** Trade `boar meat` for `1x Furlin`
* **Important:** You'll need boar meat first before you can complete this trade

#### 2. Journey to the Ent Forest

**Warning:** The Ent Forest hides many dangers! Be prepared for combat.

* Head towards the **Ent Forest** from spawn
* **Equipment Check:** Make sure you have your `amethyst tools` ready
* Stay alert - this area contains hostile creatures

#### 3. Meet Garen (Side Quest)

* **Location:** You'll encounter **Garen** on your way through the forest
* **Side Quest:** _Clear up the Ent Forest_
* **Reward:** Additional experience and loot
* **Note:** This is optional but recommended for extra rewards

#### 4. Reach the Boar Area

* **Location:** At the end of the path on the **right side** of the forest
* **Objective:** Hunt boars and collect `boar meat`
* **Tip:** You may need multiple pieces, so gather extra while you're there

#### 5. Hidden Boss Challenge (Optional)

For brave adventurers seeking an extra challenge:

* **Location:** **Left path**, behind the hill in the forest
* **Difficulty:** High - prepare for a tough fight!
